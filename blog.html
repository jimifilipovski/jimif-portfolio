			<h2>Find Your Direction</h2>
			<h6>April 23, 2013</h6>
			<blockquote>"You don't have to know what you want to do for the rest of your life. Just try and be doing something."</blockquote>
			<p>I posted this on Facebook and a lot of friends responded positively. I'm in my early twenties and like my friends I'm going through the terrifying self discovery phase. I ruminate about my life's purpose and if what I'm doing right now is what I should be doing with my life? Am I moving forward with the things I want to do?</p>
			<p>Your twenties are regarded as the most depressing time in your life. You are naive enough to take on the world but you are not sure how. My biggest accomplishment came when I realized I don't have to have it all figured out now. I can experiment with jobs and goals. I can still move forward.</p>
			<p>I can do this because I know I'm on the right track. I love the creative industry. I’ve already worked on huge projects I’d never thought I’d touch in my life. I get inspired every morning when I check out Twitter and see people doing amazing work and building great products. Some of them are not much older than myself. I knew I wanted to be a designer but that word has so many associations in today's world it's impossible to decipher what kind of designer I want to be.</p>
			<p>What good can I contribute to the world? How can I help people do amazing things? How can I be involved? These are my core values for life. If you've ever met me you know I want to do it all: author a book, start a business, speak at TED, travel the globe, put out an album, act in a film , have a successful product/service. It's all creative. It's all design. This is my direction.</p>
			<p>Find out what you love doing and start researching what would be a good fit for you. Take an internship somewhere to see if it’s what you want. You could start your career in videos games and end up doing special effects in Hollywood. Once you get out there and try things you will start to see the similarities between companies and begin to see your direction.</p>
			<p>Where my career will take me and the work I produce, I don’t know. That's whats so fascinating about it all. I can do whatever I want as long as I’m staying my course in design. The most important thing is for you to get out there and find yours. So, what’s your direction?</p>

			<h2>Learn To Say No</h2>
			<h6>April 23, 2013</h6>
			<p>For my friends who are just starting out in design, this is for you. One of the best skills to have in design is to learn to say no. Once mastered you will notice things start to happen. You start to get more of the work you want and less of what you have to do.</p>
			<p>Why is this so important? It's because you are responsible for the work you put into the world. Is your portfolio full of PowerPoint presentations? No? Then say no to the client who wants a deck made. You're a designer, and if PowerPoint is not your thing, don't do it. The world doesn't need it. The world needs you to do more of what you love and let everything else go.</p>
			<p>Saying no shapes who you are. It's a powerful word to use with clients because when you say no to a project they respect that. You are not just someone who produces work. You solve problems and communicate solutions, you think for a living. You will start getting better work from saying no. Don't be afraid of missing out on a project. If you're not working on the things you want then you're not moving forward. A common mistake in art school is students fill their portfolio with every class project they've done and the professors always ask "is this the type of work you want to be doing?" If it's not then get it out of there.</p>
			<p>Next time a new project comes up ask yourself if doing it will move you forward in your career. Can you put it in your portfolio? Will you learn from the experience? Is it something you genuinely enjoy doing? If not just remember it's good to just say no.</p>

			<h2>The Starter Leauge</h2>
			<h6>April 12, 2013</h6>
			<p>It has been two weeks since I started html/css classes at The Starter League. It's a privilege to be here in 1871. I'm surrounded by people who are smarter than me everyday. I know it's an environment for learning and collaboration. It's a chance to do something new and have an impact. It's humbling to think of the possibilities.
			Since I've started taking classes I have already mocked up a basic site and pushed it to Github. I went into the class not knowing much at all. I did have an understand of the structure of html but nothing ever clicked until now. I know there are 1000 ways to learn to code but being in The Starter League forces me to commit. It forces me to learn something every week to stay afloat.</p>

			<h3>Things I Have Learned So Far</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Sublime Text 2</li>
				<li>Linking CSS style sheets</li>
				<li>Basic site structure</li>
				<li>Pushing code to Github</li>
				<li>Hosting pages on Github</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p>As a designer I'm obsessed with working in CSS and styling my sites perfectly. I'm excited to try and design without Photoshop and just trying things out. The reason I wanted to take the class in the first place was because I want people to interact with my work. It's a delight to see how people react to the things we make but it's even more rewarding to know people are using them.</p>

			<h2>Caffe' Medici</h2>
			<h6>March 23, 2013</h6>
			<p>I’m currently sitting at the bar of Caffe´ Medici in Austin, TX. It’s Groundhog day and it’s a beautiful 76 degrees outside. It’s currently snowing in Chicago and I couldn’t be happier to escape the cold. The doors are wide open throwing a warm and fresh breeze through the cafe.</p>

			<p>Austin is a unique place with a diversity of people. Lots of families with children situate themselves here. The local UT college campus infests bar scenes with screaming kids drinking away what little money they own. Austin has lots of homeless people because lets face it, it’s warm and comfortable outside and that constitutes easy living. Caffe’ Medici is considered one of the best coffee shops in Austin. They brew single origin coffee from local roaster Cuvee´.</p>

			<p>Airpots are all brewed using large french presses and the center bar is home to the two La Marzocco espresso machines. The cappuccino art is on par with Intelligentsia’s work back home in Chicago. The people of Austin are super friendly.Austin is a big city with small town people. Here strangers actually talk to each other at the bar and have nice conversations, not the ones where some crazy guy talks to you and you say as little as possible to avoid further interrogation.</p>

			<p>Medici like numerous other cafes offers a small beer and wine selection. People come late at night and get the cozy cafe atmosphere without the pressure of the bar scene. It’s the next best thing to drinking at home. The coffee quality is outstanding but the place is not pretentious and it is not full of hipsters. It’s full of people, both young and old, families with their babies and college kids doing homework. There is a calmness throughout this cafe. It may be the gentle breeze that lofts through or it could just be that people are happy and content in Austin. They can spot outsiders like a sore thumb and at the same time they welcome you with open arms because here in Austin everyone is from elsewhere and they understand that that is ok.</p>
